### **Background**:
Bomb Brigade is an alternative version of **Minesweeper**.

This game is the first project of my **General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive** program.

_Soundtrack by **Dungeon Fugues**_

### **Gameplay**
Click any square on the board to begin. 

- If a bomb is clicked, the player instantly loses
- If an empty square is clicked, the number of adjacent bombs is displayed
- If an empty square with no adjacent bombs is clicked, it will reveal all adjacent, empty squares

The player wins by revealing all empty squares.
