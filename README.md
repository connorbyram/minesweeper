[Play Minesweeper](https://connorbyram.github.io/minesweeper/)

### **Gameplay**:
Click any square on the board to begin. 

- If a bomb is clicked, the player instantly loses
- If an empty square is clicked, the number of adjacent bombs is displayed
- If an empty square with no adjacent bombs is clicked, it will reveal all adjacent, empty squares

The player wins by revealing all empty squares.
